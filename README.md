# ProstateCancerAnalysis
A train model that analyze a prostate MRI to determine whether the prostate is cancerous or not.
The main objective of this research is to develop a model and integrate it into a web page to analyze prostate MRI scan to determine the probability that the prostate is cancerous or non-cancerous. 
The project aims to employ the use of Machine Learning technology to detect cancer in an MRI of a prostate.
The dataset used to train the machine learning model consists of a total of 867 prostate MRIs; 767 cancerous prostate MRIs and 100 non-cancerous prostate MRIs. 
The cancerous prostate MRIs were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) [3][4][5], while the non-cancerous prostate images were obtained from the Prostate MRI Database[6]
